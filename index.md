# Shared Care Agreements for transgender care

Transgender patients in the Glasgow and Greater Clyde NHS Trust (GGCNHS) face a number of difficulties in accessing care:
- Waiting times for the Sandyford GIC are now so long that they are in [contravention of the Patient Rights (Scotland) Act 2011][Waiting times] and are a source of material harm for patients subjected to them.
- Many transgender patients are without the means to access safe, stable treatment outwith the NHS, leaving them exposed to further harm.
- Primary care practitioners in GGCNHS are neither trained to support these patients nor enabled by the trust to enter into Shared Care Agreements (SCA) with registered private gender specialists, as recommended by [GMC ethical guidelines][GMC].

The founding principles of the NHS include the assertion that healthcare should be delivered in such a way "that it meet the needs of everyone" and is "based on clinical need, not ability to pay". This should be as true for gender-affirming care as for any other type of care.

In order to support our GPs in providing the best care for their transgender patients, **we ask for the approval of medications that are commonly used in gender-affirming care for Shared-Care Agreements** with gender specialists. The approved medications should include, but not necessarily be limited to:
  - Estradiol
  - Testosterone
  - Cyproterone Acetate
  - Decapeptyl

We believe that this change will substantially improve the quality of care recieved by many transgender patients across GGCNHS and reduce the possible harm that they are exposed to.

## Background

At present, many primary care practitioners within Glasgow and Greater Clyde NHS Trust (GGCNHS) refuse to engage in any gender-affirming care of transgender patients without the advice of a specialist due to a lack of sufficient training.
Even with the support of a private specialist, GPs often refuse to participate in gender-affirming care because GGCNHS has not approved routine shared care agreements (SCA) for any hormone replacement medications. **This is in direct contravention of the guidelines for transgender care laid out by the GMC**.

At present, transgender patients in the GGCNHS area [must wait a minimum of 3 years][Sandy waiting times] to be seen by the Sandyford NHS Gender Identity Clinic, often even longer for the commencement of hormone replacement therapy.
Not only is the harm caused by this wait substantial, but its length is also [over Public Health Scotland's maximum wait times][Waiting times]: "no patient should wait longer than 12 weeks for a new outpatient appointment at a consultant-led clinic.
This includes referrals from all sources."

Upon discovering the wait ahead, or struggling to cope with declining mental health while waiting, feeling they have no other choice, transgender patients frequently resort to two paths of treatment:
- Ordering hormone replacement medications from providers abroad and self-administering with no monitoring from a healthcare professional.
A path often referred to as "self-med".
- Seeking support from a private psychiatrist to secure a referral to a private hormone replacement specialist.
An approach often referred to as "private care".

The cost of private care is often in the region of £500-750 to obtain a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, an initial appointment with a hormone replacement specialist and all requisite (though perhaps not all desirable) blood tests in the first six months of treatment.
This enormous barrier is one that many transgender people, already in a stigmatised and deprived group, do not have the means to overcome.

Even if patients can overcome this initial hurdle, the ongoing cost of treatment often becomes unsustainable -- particularly in the absence of Shared Care Agreements.
Forced cessation of hormone replacement treatment due to external factors is, in and of itself,  incredibly dangerous to the mental and physical health of transgender patients. As a result, many transgender patients resort to self-med. This path comes with substantial risks, given that many of the accessible medications have the potential to develop severe side effects in the absence of specialist monitoring.

This leaves transgender patients in GGCNHS in a difficult situation where they must either pay a significant and ongoing financial cost or suffering the excessive waiting times  for an NHS GIC.
