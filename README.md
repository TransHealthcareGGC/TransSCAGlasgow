# Background

At present, transgender patients in the Glasgow and Greater Clyde NHS(GGCNHS) area must wait a minimum of 3 years to be seen by the Sandyford NHS Gender Identity Clinic, often longer for the commencement of hormone replacement therapy.
Not only is the harm caused by this wait substantial, but its length is also over Public Health Scotland's maximum wait times: "no patient should wait longer than 12 weeks for a new outpatient appointment at a consultant-led clinic.
This includes referrals from all sources."

Upon discovering this wait, or struggling to cope with declining mental health while waiting, transgender patients frequently resort to two paths of treatment, feeling they have no other choice:
- Ordering hormone replacement medications from providers abroad and self-administering with no monitoring from a healthcare professional.
A path often referred to as "self-med".
- Seeking support from a private psychiatrist to secure a referral to a private hormone replacement specialist.
An approach often referred to as "private care".

Seeking qualified care from a private provider is expensive - often in the region of £500-750 to obtain a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, an initial appointment with a hormone replacement specialist and all requisite (though perhaps not all desirable) blood tests in the first six months of treatment.
This enormous barrier is one that many transgender people, already in stigmatised and deprived group, do not have the means to overcome.


Even if patients can overcome this initial hurdle, often ongoing monitoring becomes unsustainable or a contributing factor to financial vulnerability and declining mental health.
Forced cessation of hormone replacement treatment due to external factors is, in and of itself,  incredibly dangerous to the mental health and safety of transgender patients.

The cost of private care forces many patients resort to self-med.
The self-med path comes with substantial risks, given that many of the accessible medications to this path have the potential to develop severe side effects in the absence of specialist monitoring.

At present, it is our understanding that many primary care practitioners under the aegis of GGCNHS refuse to engage in any hormone-related support of transgender patients without the advice of a specialist due to a lack of sufficient training.
Additionally, GGCNHS has not approved routine shared care agreements(SCA) for any hormone replacement medications.
Together, these facts mean that even for transgender patients that can secure diagnosis and advice privately, GPs will not provide monitoring or prescription support in collaboration with the registered private specialist.

To summarise:
- Waiting times for the Sandyford GIC are now so long that they are in contravention of the Patient Rights (Scotland) Act 2011 and the source of material harm for patients subjected to them.
- Many transgender patients are without the means to access safe, stable treatment outwith the NHS, leaving them exposed to further harm.
- Primary care practitioners in GGCNHS are neither trained to support these patients nor enabled by the trust to enter into shared care agreements with registered private specialists who can provide appropriate advice.
Primary care practitioners find themselves in an ethically damning position as the current system guides them to leave their vulnerable transgender patients to suffer harm.

It is our opinion that this tragic situation is unbecoming of the NHS.
Its founding principles include the assertion that healthcare should be delivered in such a way "that it meet the needs of everyone" and is "based on clinical need, not ability to pay".
Gender-affirming care within GGCNHS is most assuredly not delivered in this way.
It can, and should, change.

# Proposal

We propose that NHSGGC look at the following changes, in order of priority:
- Approval of medications commonly used, off-label, in gender-affirming care for shared-care agreements as recognition of patient need.
Enable primary care practitioners in caring for their transgender patients when they have access to specialist advice.
Approved medications would ideally include, but not necessarily be limited to:
  - Estradiol
  - Testosterone
  - Cyproterone Acetate
  - Spironolactone
  - Decapeptyl
- Provision of training for primary care practitioners on the treatment of transgender patients to address concerns and build clinical expertise.
- A long-term plan for the introduction of an informed consent model for the treatment of transgender patients, following from that fact that trans identities are formally de-psycho-pathologised in ICD-11 which member countries can adopt from January 2022.
We believe that this will not only reduce the diagnostic pressure on the Sandyford GIC but that - as the most populous trust in NHS Scotland - GGCNHS has a responsibility to lead from the front on matters of specialist care which this proposal reflects.
