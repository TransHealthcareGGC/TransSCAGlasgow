# Background

At present, transgender patients in the Glasgow and Greater Clyde NHS(GGCNHS) area must wait a minimum of 3 years to be seen by the Sandyford NHS Gender Identity Clinic, often longer for the commencement of hormone replacement therapy. Not only is the harm caused by this wait substantial, its length is grotesquely in excess of Public Health Scotland maximum wait times: "no patient should wait longer than 12 weeks for a new outpatient appointment at a consultant-led clinic. This includes referrals from all sources."

Upon discovering this wait, or struggling to cope with declining mental health while waiting, transgender patients frequently resort to two paths of treatment, feeling they have no other choice:
- Ordering hormone replacement medications from providers abroad and self-administering with no monitoring from a healthcare professional. This path is often referred to as "self-med".
- Seeking support from a private psychiatrist to secure a referral to a private hormone replacement specialist. This path is often referred to as "private care".

Seeking qualified care privately is expensive - often in the region of £500-750 simply to obtain a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, an initial appointment with a hormone replacement specialist and all requisite (though perhaps not all desirable) blood tests in the first 6 months of treatment. This is an enormous barrier to entry that many in an already stigmatised and deprived group do not have the means to overcome. 

Even if patients can overcome this initial hurdle, often ongoing monitoring becomes unsustainable or a contributing factor to financial vulnerability and declining mental health. Forced cessation of hormone replacement treatment due to external factors is, in and of itself,  incredibly dangerous to the mental health and safety of transgender patients.

As such, many patients resort to self-med which comes without the costs for specialist appointments and monitoring. Needless to say, the self-med path also comes with substantial risks given that many of the accessible medications to this path have the potential to develop severe side effects in the absence of specialist monitoring.

At present, primary care practitioners under the aegis of GGCNHS refuse to engage in any hormone-related support of transgender patients without the support of a specialist due to a lack of sufficient training. This is not the case for hormone treatment of cisgender patients. Additionally, GGCNHS has not approved routine shared care agreements(SCA) for any hormone replacement medications, meaning that even for transgender patients that can secure diagnosis and advice privately, their GP will not provide any monitoring or prescription support in collaboration with their GMC-registered private specialist. Not only does this approach fly in the face of the ethical guidance issued by the GMC, it does not even align with the stated position of the Sandyford GIC which operates within the same NHS trust.

To summarise:
- Waiting times for the Sandyford GIC are now so long that they are contravention of the Patient Rights (Scotland) Act 2011 and the source of material harm for the patients subjected to them.
- Many transgender patients are without the means to access safe, stable treatment outwith the NHS, leaving them exposed to further harms.
- Primary care practitioners in GGCNHS are neither trained to support these patients, nor supported by the trust in entering into shared care agreements with registered private specialists who are able to provide them appropriate advice. This leaves these practitioners in an ethically damning position as they are systemically pressured to leave their vulnerable transgender patients to suffer harm.

It is our opinion that this tragic situation is unbecoming of the NHS, a great institution with founding principles that included the assertion that healthcare should be delivered in such a way "that it meet the needs of everyone" and is "based on clinical need, not ability to pay". This is most assuredly not the case in the provision of gender-affirming care within GGCNHS and it can, it should, change.

# Proposal

We propose that NHSGGC look at the following changes, in order of priority:
- Approval of medications commonly used, off-label, in gender-affirming care for shared-care agreements as a recognition of patient need. This would support primary care practitioners in caring for their transgender patients with access to appropriate advice. These should include, but not necessarily be limited to:
  - Estradiol
  - Testosterone
  - Cyproterone Acetate
  - Spironolactone
  - Decapeptyl
- Provision of training for primary care practitioners on the treatment of transgender patients to address concerns and build clinical expertise.
- A long-term plan for the introduction of an informed consent model for the treament of transgender patients, following from that fact that trans identities are formally de-psycho-pathologized in ICD-11 which member countries are able to adopt from Janurary 2022. We believe that this will not only reduce the diagnostic pressure on the Sandyford, GIC, but that - as the most populous trust in NHS Scotland - GGCNHS has a responsibility to lead from the front on matters of specialist care which this proposal reflects.
